AI-powered WhatsApp booking system with instant SMS confirmations
Who is this for?
This workflow is designed for solo entrepreneurs, consultants, coaches, clinics, or any business that handles client appointments and wants to automate the entire scheduling experience via WhatsApp â€” without the need for live agents.

What problem is this workflow solving?
Responding to inbound messages, collecting booking details, suggesting available times, and sending reminders can be a huge time drain. This workflow eliminates manual handling by:

Automating WhatsApp conversations with an AI assistant
Booking appointments directly into Cal.com
Sending timely SMS reminders before appointments
It ensures you never miss a lead or a follow-up â€” even while you sleep.

What this workflow does
From a single WhatsApp message, the workflow:

Triggers via a WhatsApp webhook
Uses GPT-4 to handle conversation flow and qualify the prospect
Collects name, email, selected service
Calls Cal.com API to fetch available time slots
Books the appointment and stores it in Google Sheets
Sends a confirmation message via WhatsApp
Periodically scans for upcoming appointments
Sends SMS reminders to clients 2 hours before their session
Setup
Connect your Webhook node to a WhatsApp API (e.g., 360dialog, Twilio, or Ultramsg)
Add your OpenAI API key for the GPT-4 nodes
Configure your Cal.com API key and set your calendar ID
Link your Google Sheets with fields like: name, email, date, time, status, reminder_sent
Connect your SMS service (e.g., sms77) with API credentials
Adjust the schedule in the reminder node as needed
How to customize this workflow to your needs
Change the language or tone of the AI assistant by editing the system prompt in the GPT node
Filter available time slots by service, team member, or duration
Modify the reminder timing (e.g., 1 hour before, 24h before, etc.)
Add conditional logic to route users to different booking flows based on their responses
Integrate additional CRMs or notification channels like email or Slack
